    "This point shapefile was created as a guide to New York City’s non-neighborhood place locations that appear in “New York: A City of Neighborhoods.” These place locations include parks, cemeteries, and airports. Best estimates of label centroids were established at a 1:1,000 scale, but are ideally viewed at a 1:50,000 scale."
